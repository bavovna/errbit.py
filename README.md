errbit.py
=========

Python client for [Errbit](https://github.com/errbit/errbit). This repo has been [migrated off GitHub](https://gitlab.com/dead-code/errbit.py) due to GitHub weak statement in regards to russian attack on :ukraine:.
Continuing doing business as usual with :ru: is simply unacceptible, and $100k one time donation does not fix that.
